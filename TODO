- Make the release build actually build.

- Shallow read pointer chains should include both a basename and
  a pathname. Don't use std::string, do what memcry does.

- STL fstreams are a fucking disaster, just mmap() and typecast.
	> While refactoring, make sure exceptions wont leak file
	  descriptors, etc.

- Go add rich pointers to memcry and pass around rich pointers.
	> a rich pointer should include:
		- raw foreign pointer
		- area node
		- area offset
		- object node
		- object offset
		- whether rich pointer is still valid
	> register rich pointers with a mc_vm_map, so that on map updates 
	  they can be updated or invalidated

- Go add a way to fetch an area's object to memcry, be it real or last
  object. Migrate tracing to use this.

- Remove all STL:
	> streams
	> strings

- Try to remove all STL:
	> hashmaps (use cmore's red-black tree instead)
	> smart pointers (why are we using them in the first place?)
	> vectors (again, use cmore)

- Update tests to be more QA style instead of unreliable assertions.

- Purge all other bloated STL components.
