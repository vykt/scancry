1) Add an exclude address ranges constraint

2) Both the pointer scanner and pattern scanner need to be able to only
   scan every Nth address. There needs to be an additional callback in
   the `_scan` interface that fetches the next i given the current i.

3) Instead of using std::function in the worker, use templates.
